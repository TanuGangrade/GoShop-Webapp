dispatch means run




->USE EFFECT:
  If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) 
  as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it
  never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows directly from how the dependencies array 
  always works.
  While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount

->Props
    .MATCH
    // match is from (URL)
    A match object contains information about how a <Route path> matched the URL. match objects contain the following properties:
    params - (object) Key/value pairs parsed from the URL corresponding to the dynamic segments of the path
    isExact - (boolean) true if the entire URL was matched (no trailing characters)
    path - (string) The path pattern used to match. Useful for building nested <Route>s
    url - (string) The matched portion of the URL. Useful for building nested <Link>s


    .HISTORY
    https://reactrouter.com/web/api/history
    push(path, [state]) - (function) Pushes a new entry onto the history stack

    .LOCATION
    shows whatevers after the ? in url



->Making a params in url optional
  "/cart/:id?"
  the ? makes it optional

->getState: get all the reducers(in store.js)

->we useDispatch(action) and useSelector to get anything form the redux state
