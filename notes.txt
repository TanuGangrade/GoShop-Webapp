USE EFFECT:
If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) 
as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it
 never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows directly from how the dependencies array 
 always works.
 While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount
